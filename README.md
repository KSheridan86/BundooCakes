## Description
This is a static site built using HTML, CSS/Bootstrap & Javascript for a craft bakery.
Deciding on this project was pretty easy as it has been built as a real world, live site for a friend of mine's home bakery business.
Although she already has a presence on social media, this site provides another avenue for potential customers to find her products. It includes pictures, information, prices and a form to get in touch with the baker directly for information or to make an order. 

Having a website alongside social media accounts can help to create a centralized hub for potential customers to find information about the products and services on offer. A website can also act as a powerful marketing tool, allowing them to showcase their brand and create a professional online presence. Additionally, it can help them to drive more traffic to their social media accounts, as well as providing a platform for collecting valuable customer data.

According to a report by Bord Bia (the Irish Food Board), the bakery sector in Ireland is estimated to be worth over â‚¬500 million per year, with the artisanal and craft bakery sector representing a significant portion of that market. This report also notes that there has been a growing demand for artisanal and craft bakery products in Ireland, particularly among younger consumers who are seeking out high-quality, locally produced food products.

## Theme 

The main theme chosen for this site was 'Simplicity', the question I considered at every step was:

`Is it
Minimal, Clean, Slick, Professional?`


Therefore I chose only a few simple colors to highlight the quality of the images themselves.

These were:
A liner gradient on the body that shifts between shades of pink and green:

- ![#f8d9d3](https://placehold.co/15x15/f8d9d3/f8d9d3.png) `#f8d9d3`
- ![#ebc2b9](https://placehold.co/15x15/ebc2b9/ebc2b9.png) `#ebc2b9`
- ![#cbdabc](https://placehold.co/15x15/cbdabc/cbdabc.png) `#cbdabc`
- ![#a1c8b9](https://placehold.co/15x15/a1c8b9/a1c8b9.png) `#a1c8b9`


Dark Green used for buttons, navbar and the footer. 
- ![#23967f](https://placehold.co/15x15/23967f/23967f.png) `#23967f`



To ensure it was visible over the chosen elements background color the text was then either:
- ![#f5f5f5](https://placehold.co/15x15/f5f5f5/f5f5f5.png) `Whitesmoke - #f5f5f5`

or
- ![#000000](https://placehold.co/15x15/000000/000000.png) `Black - #000000`


The images contained these colors but were also rich in various hues of yellow, orange, red, green and blue.
By keeping the color scheme simple the colors in the images get to take center stage.

I then implemented a scroll style which would maximize the impact of the header image.
By giving the header image a position of "sticky" it would stick to the top of the page and let the following text roll over the top.

## Wireframes
BalsamiQ was used to create Desktop and Mobile designs for each page of the site (Tablet size devices follow the Mobile design layout).

## Features

> ### Navigation menu 

On mobile the main navigation menu is housed inside a hamburger menu. This slides open from the side and includes all navigation links. This was based on a bootstrap 5 navbar.
On tablets or bigger devices the menu is spread across the header bar which also contains the logo.

> ### Logo 

The logo is simply the name of the bakery and a picture of a cupcake, this sits at the top left of the page and is universal across the site.

Testing was done in a number of ways.

 > #### Manual Testing
 
 This was undertaken by myself, my wife and a number of friends.
 We tested all links to confirm they worked and opened on a new blank page and went where they were supposed to. Multiple devices were used to confirm the site worked as it should and it displayed correctly across different screen sizes and browsers.


 > #### Online Testing

 All code was run through a validator and returned zero errors.
 These validator sites were:

- [Jigsaw css Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_uri)
- [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
- [JsHint Validator](https://jshint.com/)


Screenshots of all these results can be found below.

> #### Responsive Testing


This website allowed me to select a number of devices with different size screens and viewports and see how my website looked on each of them. The result of which is displayed [here](#bundoo-cakes) at the top of this page

- [Responsive Checker](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive)

> #### Google Lighthouse

Google Lighthouse is an open-source, automated tool for auditing the performance, accessibility, best practices, and search engine optimization (SEO) of web pages. It was created by Google and is built into Google Chrome's DevTools, making it easily accessible for developers and webmasters.

Lighthouse provides a comprehensive report on a web page's performance, including metrics such as load time, page size, and number of requests. It also identifies areas for improvement and provides recommendations on how to fix them.

In addition to performance, Lighthouse also analyzes a page's accessibility, including color contrast, keyboard navigation, and other factors that affect users with disabilities. It also checks for adherence to best practices, such as use of HTTPS and correct use of images and metadata.

The results of this report are shown below.

### Website Optimization & SEO

> ##### Optimization
To help the site reach a broader audience some optimization methods were implemented, these included -
- Speed Optimization

Photos were cropped, compressed and converted to a web friendly format. Pre-load, Lazy loading and defer methods were used when loading resources to help speed up content delivery
- UX Optimization

Intuitive navigation, clear calls to action and a simple, easy to follow layout were adopted from the start. 
Ensuring all images were served with an alt text, adhering to proper heading structure and ensuring the contrast between text and background colors were some of the ways I improved accessibility.

> ##### SEO
A few simple measures were introduced to improve the sites visibility to search engines, these included -
- Meta Tags

 Description tag, to give the potential visitor to the site an enticing message.

 Keywords tag, this provides a list of keywords to help search engines understand the content of the site.


- Robots.txt file

Here we can tell web crawlers which pages they can or cannot visit, this is useful for sites that are still under construction or have pages that are not ready for public viewing.

- Sitemap.xml file

This tells search engines which pages to index. By creating and submitting a sitemap, it can help to ensure that the site is indexed for search engines.
